    <h1>Movie API</h1>
    <p>
      The objective of this project is to build a server-side component of a
      "movies" web application. The web application will provide users with
      access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users
      will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a
      list of their favourite movies.
    </p>

    <h3>Endpoints</h3>
    <p>
      The table below documents the endpoints in this API - including details of
      what URL endpoints to target, the data to send as parameters and the data
      to expect as responses.
    </p>
